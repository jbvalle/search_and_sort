<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<strong>Part 1: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>
* Create Randomized Array of size 8, 16, 64 generating numbers between -32.768 - 32767 <br />
* Implement following sorting algorithms and sort array increasingly <br />
- Mergesort <br />
- Quicksort <br />
- Bubblesort <br />
- Insertionsort <br />
* Display random and sorted array

<strong>Part 2: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>

* Generate randomized array of following sizes: 8, 32, 128, 512, 2048, 8192, 32768<br /> 
* Apply all sorting algorithms and sort in an increasing and ascending fashion<br />
* Perform a performance analysis on all sorting algorithm<br /> 

<strong>Part 3: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>
* Perform bubblesort for an array of size 2000 and repeat 20x <br />
* For each cycle start a runtime analysis and compare and parse the result <br />
* Evaluate the minimum, maximum and average runtime values <br />

<strong>Part 4: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>
* Implement insertionsort for a linked list
* Generate randomized array of size 2048 as well a linked list with 2048 elements holding the same random values <br />
* Perform insertionsort for both datastructures and evaluate their runtime performance as well as their initialization time <br />
